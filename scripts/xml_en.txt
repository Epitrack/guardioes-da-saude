<string name="about_text">“GUARDIANS OF HEALTH” APPLICATION\n\nDeveloped for mobiles, tablets, and personal computers, the “Guardians of Health” app is part of an initiative by the Brazilian Ministry of Health, in partnership with the U.S.-based NGO Skoll Global Threats Fund. It is designed to assess the potential of mobile apps  to strengthen the detection of public health emergencies and outbreaks within the Sistema Único de Saúde [Brazilian Unified Healthcare System] (SUS), particularly during major events, such as the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games. \n\nThis strategy builds on another project launched by the same organization, entitled "Saúde na Copa”, launched exclusively during the 2014 FIFA Brazil World Cup®, which yielded promising results. These results encouraged both institutions  to develop a new strategy for the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games. \n\nThis updated version of the Guardians of Health app is available for Apple iOS and Google Android operating systems, as well as on the http://guardioesdasaude.org/website.n\nInitially developed in Portuguese, this version of the “Guardians of Health” app is also available in all of the official languages of the United Nations. It is proivded as a tool to assist Brazilians and foreign visitors to Brazil, particularly those traveling to the host cities of the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games.  \n\nOnly users over the age of 13 can participate in this initiative. In addition, users must read and accept the “Terms of Use” before signing up and fill out the simplified registration form, providing a nickname, email address, date of birth, race/color, gender, and password. Participation is voluntary and confidential, and all personal information disclosed is duly protected by Law No. 12.527, dated November 18, 2011.\n\nProject results will be used for health surveillance purposes across all Brazilian States and Municipalities, in order to detect and prevent public health emergencies and outbreaks by adopting proper prevention and control measures. The project’s results will be presented as aggregated and anonymzed data, describing the health profiles of users based on the information provided by them. \n\nVOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION\n\nYour participation is entirely voluntary and a valuable contribution towards promoting health surveillance in Brazil. Reporting your health condition shall not be interpreted as a medical consultation and does not ensure special access to health care services. In addition, participants will never be contacted via email or any other means by any healthcare service or professional to obtain such information. \n\nText messages can be sent to participants through Push Notification technology, containing health information or instructions from health surveillance agencies. \n\nIt is important to point out that you should immediately seek out the nearest healthcare service or physician if you are not feeling well. The app provides a shortcut to a preset search of healthcare services and drugstores near you, based on your mobile phone’s Google Maps geolocation service. This feature is not part of the app. Therefore, you will be redirected to your mobile phone’s map application. We recommend caution when transiting through unknown areas and avoiding areas of risk. Contact local public agencies for more information. \n\nThe app provides useful phone numbers, including SAMU (Emergency Mobile Ambulance Service), which is a 24/7 toll-free number providing emergency healthcare services for trauma, clinical, pediatric, surgical, gynecological, and mental health cases in households, workplaces and public roads.\n\nBENEFITS OF PARTICIPATION\n\n·       Actively participating in health surveillance efforts to prevent disease outbreaks in communities;\n\n·       Quick access to public service contact information without altering your phonebook;\n\n·       Easy access to useful information on health and disease prevention measures;\n\n·       Amenities such as a preset search of Emergency Care Units and drugstores nearby (20-km radius) in Google Maps;\n\n·       Following the project results at the website: www.guardioesdasaude.org;\n\nLEARN MORE ABOUT THE APP\n\nThe “Guardians of Health” app is free and available for iOS and Android operating systems, as well as Internet browsers. Users can choose from one of the several free Wi-Fi hotspots available in various cities or use their own mobile data packages to use the app. \n\nPhone calls to public services listed in the app may be subject to additional phone charges. Contact your mobile carrier for more information before using this feature. This service cannot be used if the mobile’s phone feature is disabled. This information applies particularly to foreign users. \n\nABOUT THE PARTNERSHIP\n\nThis pioneer initiative was conceived by the Health Surveillance Agency of the Brazilian Health Ministry, in partnership with the host cities of the Olympic and Paralympic Games. The Skoll Global Threats Fund  is responsible for all contracting and software development expenses, duly supervised by the Brazilian Association of Field Epidemiology Professionals (ProEpi), both of which are non-profit Non-Governmental Organizations focused on improving health surveillance activities in Brazil and around the world.\n\nProEpi is responsible for ensuring that all requirements established by the Ministry of Health and Skoll Global Threats Fund are met, as per project specifications: confidentiality of user information, transparency and disclosure of public results, and availability of the source code and respective documentation in free-access download environments, adequacy and use of applications by healthcare services in Brazil and other countries, while preserving the non-profit nature of such an endeavor. \n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe organizing institutions would like to thank all participants, health professionals, and managers of the Brazilian Unified Healthcare System for putting their trust in the pilot project and supporting such an unprecedented initiative in the global health space. \n\nSpecial thanks to the Departments of Health of the Host Cities of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (Belo Horizonte, Distrito Federal, Manaus, Rio de Janeiro, Salvador, and São Paulo.) </string>

Avoid direct exposure to sunlight between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.; \n\n•       Use sunscreen with the appropriate protection factor based on your skin tone, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. This will make sure your skin is always protected, even in colder locations; \n\n •       Use insect repellents when necessary; \n\n•       Wash your hands with water and soap several times a day, especially before eating, after using public transportation, visiting markets or highly-populated areas; \n\n•       Driving after consuming any amount of alcoholic beverages is prohibited in Brazil.</string>

PEP is recommended for individuals exposed to HIV risk, such as those engaged in casual sex, sexual abuse and work accidents involving biological materials.\n\n•       If recommended by the doctor, the PEP treatment lasts 28 days and must be initiated within 72 hours after unprotected sexual contact.\n\nWhere can I find the PEP treatment? http://pep.aids.gov.br\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES\n\n•       Everyone is entitled to information and medical care without being subject to any form of prejudice or discrimination. \n\n•       In Brazil, male and female condoms and lubricant gels are distributed free-of-charge in all healthcare units, hostels, and Tourist Centers, among others. Find out which distribution centers are near you.\n\n•       If you need any HIV medication (lost or forgot), seek out the nearest healthcare unit and bring your ID document. Foreign tourists must contact their health insurance. \n\nREMEMBER\n\n•       Avoid viral hepatitis infections. If you are looking to get tattoos or piercings, always choose establishments duly licensed and certified by the local Health Regulatory agency. Demand to see the certificate if it is now visibly shown at the establishment.\n\n•       Demand all materials to be duly sterilized or disposable.\n\n•       Do not share personal objects, such as nail cutters, razors, tooth brushes, needles and syringes with others.\n\n•       If you notice any sign or symptom, such as any discharges or lesions, or any other health problem, seek out medical assistance.\n\nDID YOU KNOW?\n\n•       Many people live their lives without knowing that they are infected with HIV and viral hepatitis. \n\n•       The only way to know is by taking the test. Anti-HIV and hepatitis tests are provided free-of-charge in the public healthcare system. Foreign tourists must contact their health insurance. \n\n•       There is a vaccine for Hepatitis B, which must be taken in 3 doses at different times.

<string name="zika_content_01">\n\n•       The Dengue fever, Zika and Chikungunya viruses are transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito and cause similar signs and symptoms. \n\n•       It is very important to immediately seek out the nearest healthcare service after experiencing fever, red spots on the body, body aches, joint pains or itching. \n\n•       Try to find out whether there are other cases of Dengue fever, Zika or Chikungunya in your neighborhood or city. \n\n•       If you suspect you might have Dengue fever, Zika or Chikungunya, drink plenty of fluids.\n\n•       The main preventive measure is to prevent Aedes aegypti mosquitoes from breeding, since these mosquitoes transmit all three diseases. \n\n•       Pregnant women may only use skin insect repellents certified by ANVISA and only as instructed in the respective product label. Pregnant women can safely use DEET, Icaridin (Picaridin), and EBAAP (IR3535) products. \n\n•       Children under the age of 2 shall not use DEET-based products. Concentration must not exceed 10% and products must not be applied more than three times a day in children between the ages of 2 and 12. Concentrations higher than 10% are permitted for children over the age of 12.\n\n•       Room repellents, such as electric repellents or spirals shall not be used in poorly-ventilated areas or in the presence of people with asthma or respiratory allergies. Such repellents can be used in any room, provided that they are placed at least two meters away from people. \n\nDENGUE FEVER\n\n•       Dengue fever is the most common of these three diseases, with which the Brazilian population is already familiarized. \n\n•       Never take acetylsalicylic acid drugs (e.g. ASA, Aspirin, etc.) or anti-inflammatory drugs. These drugs could increase the risk of hemorrhage complications (bleeding) in case of diseases such as Dengue fever. \n\n•       Look out for signs that may indicate Dengue fever complications: shortness of breath, dizziness, abdominal pains or bleeding.\n\n•       Immediately seek out medical assistance after experiencing any sign or symptom of Dengue fever. \n\nChikungunya\n\n•       The first recorded cases of infection by Chikungunya in Brazil occurred in 2014.\n\n Immediately seek out medical assistance after experiencing any sign or symptom of Chikungunya. \n\nZIKA\n\n•       The first recorded cases of infection by Zika virus in Brazil occurred in 2015.\n\n•       Most people infected with the Zika virus (more than 80%) never show any signs or symptoms. \n\n•       Very little is known about the complications caused by Zika virus infections. Some neurological symptoms (facial palsy, weakness in legs and Guillain-Barré Syndrome) seldom occur a few days after the acute infection stage. Infection during pregnancy may lead to severe congenital malformations, particularly microcephaly. \n\n•       There is no specific treatment available for infections by Zika virus. \n\n•       Immediately seek out medical assistance after experiencing any sign or symptom of Zika virus infection. \n\nMAKE SURE YOU KEEP THE MOSQUITOES AWAY:\n\n•       Always keep water barrels and vessels properly sealed.\n\n•       Wash the inside of water tanks with soap and brush at least once a week.\n\n•       Always keep water tanks properly sealed. Also place a screen in the water tank overflow pipe.\n\n•       Remove leaves, twigs and anything else that may obstruct water passage through gutters and chutes.\n\n•       Never let water accumulate in rooftops.\n\n•       Fill plant saucers with sand until the edge.\n\n•       Alternatively, wash plant saucers at least once a week.\n\n•       Change the water in aquatic plant pots and wash them with water, soap and brush at least once a week.\n\n•       Put the trash in plastic bags and keep the trash can properly sealed.\n\n•       Make sure all trash bags are properly closed and left out of the reach of animals.\n\n•       Always store empty bottles facing down to avoid any water accumulation.\n\n•       Tires must always be stored in sheltered locations.\n\n•       Make sure swimming pools and water fountains are regularly cleaned with proper chemical products.\n\n•       Place a screen over open drains to prevent the mosquito from accessing the water.\n\n•       Put sand in all recipients that may accumulate water.\n\n•       Never let water accumulate in fallen leaves and bottle caps.\n\n•       Toilets that are not used or only occasionally used must be covered and checked once a week.\n\n•       Always clean air conditioner trays to prevent water accumulation.\n\n•       Tarpaulins used to cover objects or debris must be flush and stretched to avoid any water puddles.\n\nIn case of doubts or questions regarding Dengue fever, Zika and Chikungunya, contact the Health Hotline (136) and select option 3. </string>
